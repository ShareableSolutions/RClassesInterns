Installing R
To install R on Windows, Mac, or Linux, go to the Comprehensive R Archive Network
(CRAN) main page at https://cran.r-project.org/ , where you can select the relevant
operating system.
For Windows users, the installation file includes both the 32-bit and the 64-bit versions. You
can either install one of the versions or the hybrid version, which includes both the 32-bit
and 64-bit versions. Technically, after the installation, you can start working with R using
the built-in Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
However, it is highly recommended to install the RStudio IDE and set it as your working
environment for R. RStudio will make your code writing and debugging and the use of
visualization tools or other applications easier and simple.
RStudio offers a free version of its IDE, which is available at
