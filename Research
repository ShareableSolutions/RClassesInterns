GitHub: This is known as a hosting service for version control with Git, but it is
also a great platform for sharing code, reporting errors, or getting answers. Each
R package has its own repository that contains information about the package
and provides a communication channel between the users and the package
maintainer (to report errors).
Package documentation and vignettes: This provides information about the
package's functions and examples of their uses.
Google it: If you couldn't find the answer you were looking for in the preceding
resources, then Google it, and try to find other resources. You will be surprised
by the amount of information that's available for R out there.
